# B44.Standards

B44 studio build policy as a package. **Studio-internal tooling** — published so
our own repos can restore it without credentials; it encodes B44 conventions and
isn't a general-purpose library.

Reference it with `PrivateAssets="all"` and it applies, via buildTransitive
assets:

- SDK analyzers at `AnalysisMode=Recommended`, a curated Meziantou allowlist, and
  banned-API rules — severities in a packaged global analyzer config.
- `CA1502` / `MA0051` complexity and method-length thresholds.
- NuGet vulnerability audit on restore.
- Opt-in synchronization of canonical organization/game guidance into marked
  root `CLAUDE.md` sections, plus recursive sibling `AGENTS.md` generation.

Opt-in flags:

- `<B44Deterministic>true</B44Deterministic>` — bans ambient time/randomness
  (`DateTime.Now`, `new Random()`, …); inject `TimeProvider` / an explicit random
  source instead.
- `<B44EngineFreeCore>true</B44EngineFreeCore>` — additionally bans Godot APIs and
  fails the build if a Godot assembly reaches the resolved reference graph
  (implies determinism).

Agent guidance synchronization is off unless a repository opts in from its
root `Directory.Build.props`:

```xml
<B44AgentSyncEnabled>true</B44AgentSyncEnabled>
<B44AgentGuidanceProfile>Organization</B44AgentGuidanceProfile>
<B44AgentRepositoryRoot>$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)</B44AgentRepositoryRoot>
<B44AgentSyncProject>$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)src\App\App.csproj</B44AgentSyncProject>
```

Use `Game` instead of `Organization` to add the game rules. Set
`B44GameCoreProject` to the mandatory engine-free `*.Core.csproj`, make that
same project the synchronization anchor, and set `B44EngineFreeCore=true` in
its project file. The anchor makes synchronization run once; all paths remain
repository-relative.
Local builds update managed files, while
`-p:B44AgentSyncVerifyOnly=true` validates them without writing.

All B44 repositories, including released and production consumers, reference
internal packages through a compatibility-bounded float. Pre-1.0 packages use
`0.<minor>.*` (for example, `B44.Standards` and `B44.Common` currently use
`0.4.*`); stable packages use `<major>.*`. Breaking changes bump the excluded
minor or major boundary and require a deliberate consumer edit. Never use an
unbounded `*`. Changes that expand Standards enforcement bump the Standards
minor version rather than entering an existing patch float.

Synchronization does not traverse common dependency, build-output, coverage,
publish, IDE, or virtual-environment directories, and it never follows directory
reparse points. Repositories can add their own generated or imported subtrees;
paths are interpreted relative to `B44AgentRepositoryRoot` and must remain
inside it:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <B44AgentSyncExclude Include="generated-site" />
  <B44AgentSyncExclude Include="vendor/imported-project" />
</ItemGroup>
```
